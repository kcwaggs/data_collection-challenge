# data_collection-challenge
Module 11 Challenge 
Coding is conducted in the 'coding' folder and results/resources stored in the 'resources' folder. 

## part_1_mars_news.ipynb
In this code we scrub the titles and brief summary lines from the web page. \
These are added into dictionaries and displayed in the results of the code. 

## part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
In this code we scrape the web page to analyze a data table. \
We extract the data, conduct some analysis, and create plots to represent our results. \
Results from the extracted data are stored in a CSV file in the 'resources' folder ('mars_temp_data.csv')

### HTML scraping
I included screenshots of the inspection panel in Chrome when identifying what bits of data we need to grab. \
These are stored in the nested 'html_screenshots' folder in the 'resources' folder.
